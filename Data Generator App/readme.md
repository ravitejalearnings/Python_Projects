# Synthetic Data Generator Application

## Purpose of the Application
The **Synthetic Data Generator App** is designed to create realistic fake/synthetic datasets for various domains using the Python `Faker` module. The generated data can be utilized by:
- **Data Analysts** for exploratory data analysis and testing.
- **Data Engineers** for pipeline testing and prototyping.
- **Data Scientists** for building and evaluating machine learning models.

Additionally, the generated datasets can be seamlessly integrated into various Business Intelligence (BI) tools to simulate real-world business use cases.

## Key Outcomes
- Generate **synthetic data** tailored to specific domains.
- Export the generated data in **CSV format** for immediate use.
- Enable users to create domain-specific datasets with customizable features.
